Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. Airbnb experience hosts share their passions and interests with both travelers and locals.

Our team set out to predict the price per night for a given property in New York City to maximize revenue for the host.
