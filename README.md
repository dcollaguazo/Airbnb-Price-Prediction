Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. Airbnb experience hosts share their passions and interests with both travelers and locals.

Our team set out to predict the price per night for a given property in New York City to maximize revenue for the host. According to the website Inside Airbnb “Income levels for the average New Yorker haven't kept pace, and affordability is at record lows. Housing is scarce; homelessness levels are increasing; food insecurity is growing; and economic and racial inequality rates in New York City are near the highest in the United States” (Inside Airbnb). This makes the perfect environment to succeed in short term rentals. Not only is tourism accommodation taken care of, but rentals without a commitment as well. While there has been a huge move against Airbnb by the New York State Attorney General due to the lack of taxes and regulations, many hosts in NYC currently rent out multiple properties. 

The team wanted to see which factors would affect the daily price per night of a listing. The original Airbnb data for New York City came with 105 features and about 50,000 instances in 2019. However, as we cleansed the data, we focused on only 45 features for our model. We explore multiple regression algorithms to predict our target, along with parameter tuning.

Additionally, we are suggesting to use Natural Language Processing to feature engineer text that might be relevant to predict price.
